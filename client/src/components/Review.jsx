  <div className="review-text">The trullo is beautiful and was perfect for our family of 5 with 3 small children. The location was ideal for our day trips to Ostuni, Alberobello, Zoosafari, and Monopoli. Anna is a wonderful host who offered excellent, helpful suggestions...like Ostuni's Saturday market.</div>
